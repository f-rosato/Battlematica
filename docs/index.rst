Battlematica
============

Battlematica is an open source Python coding game and research framework created by Federico Rosato.
You write the AI for simulated battle bots and let them fight.

It was mainly inspired by the awesome Gladiabots_ by GFX47_ (check it out!), of which is a coder-oriented clone with slightly simplified mechanics.

It's licensed under GPL-v3.
